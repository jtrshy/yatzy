## Yatzy
This repository was initially created during Lab 1 for CSI 3140 20245. It now serves as the repository for Lab 4, a Yatzy game implementation using HTML and JS.

Note: As stated in the instructions for Lab 4, completion of the engine is not required to satisfy the lab. Following this, steps 1 to 3 have been completed, whereas step 4, being optional, has not been implemented.
