# Fonts and colours used
Currently, the default fonts and font colours are used as there has been no requirement of changing it or any need to use CSS styling. There are no other notable colours to mention as a game UI has not been implemented (as there is no lab task corresponding to this).

# Starting a new game
The "starting a new game" functionality has not been implemented as it has not been a required task from any of the labs. However, a very basic HTML page for the game has been created.

# In game play (the board and game controls)
The "in game play" functionality has not been implemented as it has not been a required task from any of the labs. However, a dice roller and game state tracker has been implemented as per tasks in lab 4.

# Scoreboard
The "scoreboard" functionality has not been implemented as it has not been a required task from any of the labs.

# End of game
The "end of game" functionality has not been implemented as it has not been a required task from any of the labs.

# Additional concepts (e.g. header, footer)
The "additional concepts" functionality has not been implemented as it has not been a required task from any of the labs.

# Notes
As seen above, only the requirements for lab satisfaction has been implemented.
